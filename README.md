# JavaCollections_hashset
This is Java implementation of a HashSet data structure. HashSet class implements Set interface of the Java collections framework.
Set ensures uniquness of it elements, i.e. all elements are distinct. 
Set offers no unique methods apart from those in the collection framework. Some methods used in this exercise are
  1. add(element)
  2. remove(elements)
  3. boolean contains(element).
Set interface does not have get(index) method to get elements. THerefore I have implemented Iterable<E> interface to iterate through the set.
